-> INIT: "git init" -> This initializes new empty Git repository in our current directory;  U = untracked

-> ADD: "git add" -> This STAGES files that we later want to commit. We can add all files or particular      files;  A = add  
        To UNSTAGE files "git reset";

-> COMMIT: "git commit -m 'This is a commit' " This takes the files out of the staging;

-> BRANCHES: This helps experiment with code without affecting the MAIN branch, also helps collaborating
    - "git branch" See the branches;
    - "git checkout -b bransa" To create a new branch;


-> MERGE: "git merge bransa" This glues the branch we have been working with the main branch
       - "git merge master" This is the way to merge the master branch to your branch so you can get the    latest code if changes where made to it


*TO PUSH THE CODE TO THE ONLINE REPOSITORY, GITHUB GIVES YOU THE COMMANDS WITH THE URL TO THE REPO*

Note: IF PUSH FAILS: "git show refs" - if there are refs you should use "git push origin HEAD:master" 
                -> This states that you want to push the local ref HEAD to the remote ref MASTER 

"git push origin" --delete remoteBranchName TO DELETE A BRANCH

"gitk --all" to examine the repo
